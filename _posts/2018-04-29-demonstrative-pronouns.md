title: Demonstrative Pronouns

## Definition
This, that, these, those. For examples, "I like **this**", "I want **that**".

In Spanish, demonstrative pronouns look identical to demonstrative _adjectives_,
except that the pronouns all carry an accent mark. For example, "This car" is
`Este coche` while "I like this (car)" is `Me gusta éste`.

Another note is that there are three _neuter_ demonstrative pronouns which are
kind of the equivalents of the English "it". Full table:

|             | Masculine | Feminine  | Neuter
|:---         |:---       |:---       |:---
| this        | éste      | ésta      | esto
| these       | éstos     | éstas     |
| that        | ése       | ésa       | eso
| those       | ésos      | ésas      |
| that (far)  | aquél     | aquélla   | aquello
| those (far) | aquéllos  | aquéllas  |

Note that the neuter ones _don't carry an accent mark_.
