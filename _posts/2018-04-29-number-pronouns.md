title: Numbers as Pronouns
category: [ spanish ]
---

## Definition
When the noun after a number is omitted, the number serves as a pronoun. For
example, "How many books do you have?", "I have **three** (kids)". Or, "Which book
is your favorite?", "The **third** (book)".

Both cardinal and ordinal numbers can be used as pronouns.

## Numbers Below 10

| Cardinal Numbers  | Ordinal Numbers   |
|:----------------- |:----------------- |
| uno, una          | primero, primera  |
| dos               | segundo, segunda  |
| tres              | tercero, tercera  |
| cuatro            | cuarto, cuarta    |
| cinco             | quinto, quinta    |
| seis              | sexto, sexta      |
| siete             | séptimo, séptima  |
| ocho              | octavo, octava    |
| nueve             | noveno, novena    |
| diez              | décimo, décima    |

Notes:
  - Ordinal numbers take _gender_.
  - When referring to a masculine noun, "first" and "third" drop the trailing
    `o` and become `primer` and `tercer`, respectively.

## Numbers Above 10
Cardinal numbers are the same weather below or above 10, but ordinal numbers can
be seen in two ways:
  - "number\-`avo`", e.g., `onceavo` (11th), `doceavo` (12th) and `treceavo` (13th)
  - but _more commonly_, "`el` number", e.g., `el doce` (11th), `el doce` (12th)
    and `el trece` (13th)

## Cardinal Numbers as Pronouns
Pretty much the same as in English. For example, `¿Cuántos libros tienes?`,
`Tengo tres.`.

## Ordinal Numbers as Pronouns
The only additional thing needs to be noted is that ordinal numbers have to
agree on _gender_ with the omitted noun. For example, `El árbol es el séptimo`
(the tree is the seventh) and `La lámpara es la segunda` (the lamp is the
second). Note that the definitive articles used need to agree on gender too.
