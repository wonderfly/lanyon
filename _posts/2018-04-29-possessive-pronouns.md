## Definition
Mine, yours, his, hers, theirs. Note the distinction between a possessive
pronoun and a possessive adjective (e.g., my, your, his, her, their).

## Gender and Number
Possessive pronouns have to agree with both the _gender_ and _number_ of the
object owned or possessed, and _not the owner_. For example, "The girls read the
books of theirs" - `Las muchachas leen los libros suyos`. Full table:

| Singular            | Plural
|:---                 |:----
| mío, míos     mine  | nuestro, nuestros    ours
| mía, mías     mine  | nuestra, nuestras    ours
| tuyo, tuyos,  yours | vuestro, vuestros    yours
| tuya, tuyas,  yours | vuestra, vuestras    yours
| suyo, suyos,  his, hers, theirs, (formal) yours | suyo, suyos, theirs, (formal) yours
| suya, suyas,  his, hers, theirs, (formal) yours | suya, suyas, theirs, (formal) yours

In contrast, these are the possessive adjectives. You may have noticed that the
first and second person informal plural have the same form as adjective as well
as pronoun.

| Singular        | Plural
|:---             |:---
| mi, mis     my  | nuestro, nuestros     our
|                 | nuestra, nuestras     our
| tu, tus     your| vuestro, vuestros     your
|                 | vuestra, vuestras     your
| su, sus     his, her, (formal) your | su, sus   their, your

## Possessive Pronouns Following `ser`
It is the same form as in English. For example, "This book is mine" - `Este
libro es mío`, "This table is yours" - `Esta mesa es tuya`.

## Possessive Pronouns Expressing "of mine/yours/his/her/ours/theirs"
In English we like to say "a friend of mine" or "an adventure of yours". In
Spanish, there is no need to insert a `de` between the object owned and the
possessive pronoun. To say "a friend of mine" it is simply `un amigo mío`.

## Possessive Pronouns in Comparisons
When two things are compared against each other, there are two forms that can be
used. The first is the "regular comparison" that ranks the two subjects, i.e.,
"A is better/worse/taller/shorter than B". In the second form, two subjects are
brought up together but no explicit ranking is drawn. For example, "this house
is mine, while that one is yours", or "I like my house, as well as yours".

### Regular Comparisons

|:---           |:---
| more ... than   |       `más ... que`
| less ... than   |       `menos ... que`
| as ... as       |       `tan ... como`

Examples:

| My friend is taller than yours          | `Mi amigo es más alto que el tuyo`
| Their house is less elegant than yours  | `Su casa es menos elegante que la tuya`

### Irregular Comparatives
Unlike English, there are only _four_ irregular comparatives in Spanish. They
are:

```
mejor, mejores    better        mayor, mayores      older
peor, peores      worse         menor, menores      younger
```

When used with these comparatives, possessive pronouns follow the same rules
above.

### Comparative Statements
In the second form of comparison possessive pronouns follow the same rules as
well. For example:

Their house is dirty but ours is clean | `Su casa está sucia pero la nuestra está limpia`
Her books are in the kitchen and mine are in the dinning room | `Su libros están en la cocina y las míos están en el comedor`
