Note: The subtiles in this chapter are reorganized for the ease of my own
understanding. I find them more logically ordered this way than they are in the
book.

# Memory Addresses
This chapter focuses on the Intel 80x86 microprocessor memory addressing
techniques, but they should generally apply to most other processors too.

At the highest level, you have a great amount of memory cells that can be used
to store instructions to be executed by the CPU and data to be read by the CPU.
You need to tell the CPU how to access the contents of each cell so you give
them "addresses", just like every house in America has an address so mails can
be delivered. Each memory address typically points to a single _byte_ in memory.

## Segmentation
Intel thinks it is a good idea to split a big program into small logical
_segments_, each to store partial information about the program. For example,
there can be a _code segment_ for compiled instructions of the program, while
all global and static variables may reside a separate segment called the _data
segment_.  Similarly, there can be _stack segment_ designated for a process'
stack at runtime. This, when applied to the address space of a running process,
splits the entire memory into multiple segments too, each consists of a chunk of
addresses.

## Segment Selector
With segmentation, to address a memory location, a pair of identifiers are used:
`(Segmentation Selector, Offset)`. Segmentation Selector is a 16-bit number that
identifies which of the many segments this address lies in, and "Offset" tells
the distance from the start of the selected segment.

## Segment Descriptor
Other than a base address, to precisely describe a segment, at least its "size"
needs to be known. There are other characteristics of a segment that the kernel
finds useful, such as which privilege level is required to access addresses in
a segment's range, is the segment for data or code, etc. These details together,
are stored in a data structure called the _Segmentation Descriptor_.

## Global Descriptor Table (GDT) and Local Descriptor Table (LDT)
Now that we have a set of segments, each with its descriptor, we need an array
to store all these descriptors. This array is called a Descriptor Table. There
is usually a Global Descriptor Table or GDT that's shared by all processes (they
use the same segments for addressing), and optionally a per-process table called
the Local Descriptor Table.

Both tables are stored in memory themselves. To locate them, their addresses are
stored in two registers: `gdtr` and `ldtr`, respectively.

## Logical Address and Linear Address
In Intel's design, all addresses used in programs should be "Logical Addresses",
which are `(Segmentation Selector, Offset)` pairs. But the CPU doesn't
understand these pairs, so there is a designated hardware component that
_translates_ logical addresses into _Linear Addresses_, which are 32-bit
unsigned integers that range from 0x00000000 to 0xffffffff, for a memory of 4
gig bytes. This hardware component is called the _Segmentation Unit_.

## Segmentation Unit
Segmentation unit's sole purpose is to translate logical addresses into linear
addresses. It takes a `(Segment Selector, Offset)` pair, from which it gets the
_index_ into the Descriptor Table (array) of the segment to select, which then
gives the starting (base) address of that segment. Then by multiplying Offset by
8 (each descriptor in the Descriptor Table is 8-byte long) and adding the
product to the base, it gets a linear address.

## Fast Address Translation
As you can see from above section, each address translation involves one read of
the Descriptor Table (to get the descriptor of the selected segment), which sits
in memory. Because the descriptor of a segment rarely changes, it's possible to
speed up translations by loading the descriptor (8 byte) into a dedicated
register, so subsequent translations don't need to read memory, which is a
magnitude slower than reading a register.

## Segmentation in Linux
Though the concept of segmentation and splitting programs into logically related
chunks is kind of enforced by Intel processors, Linux doesn't use segmentation
much. In fact, it defines barely a handful of segments even though the maximum
allowed number is 2^13 (13-bit used for _index_ in Segment Selector).

Four main segments Linux uses are: Kernel Code Segment, Kernel Data Segment,
User Code Segment, and User Data Segment. The Segment Selector values of these
are defined by the macros `__KERNEL_CS`, `__KERNEL_DS`, `__USER_CS` and
`__USER_DS`. To address the kernel code segment, for example, the kernel simply
loads the value defined by `__KERNEL_CS` into the segmentation register.

The descriptors of each segment are as follows:

| Segment     | Base      | G   | Limit   | S   | Type  | DPL | D/B | P   |
|:---         |:---       |:--- |:---     |:--- |:---   |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| user code   | 0x00000000|1    | 0xffff  | 1   | 10    | 3   | 1   | 1   |
| user data   | 0x00000000|1    | 0xffff  | 1   | 2     | 3   | 1   | 1   |
| kernel code | 0x00000000|1    | 0xffff  | 1   | 10    | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| kernel data | 0x00000000|1    | 0xffff  | 1   | 2     | 0   | 1   | 1   |

As you can see all four segments start at address 0. This is not a mistake. In
Linux, a logical address always coincides with a linear address. Again, Linux is
not a big fan of segmentation and spends more of its design in an alternative
paging mechanism - paging - which we will talk about next.

## The Linux GDT
As mentioned above, the GDT is an array of Segment Descriptor structs. In Linux,
the array is defined as `cpu_gdt_table`, while the address and size of it are
defined in the `cpu_gdt_descr` array. It is an array because there can be
multiple GDTs: on multi-processor systems each CPU has a GDT. These values are
used to initialize the `gdtr` register.

Both arrays are 32-element long, which include 18 valid segment descriptors,
and 14 null, unused or reserved entries. Unused entries are there so that
segment descriptors accessed together are kept in the 32-byte hardware cache
line.

## The Linux LDTs
These are similar to GDTs and are not commonly used by Linux applications except
for those that run Windows applications, e.g., Wine.
