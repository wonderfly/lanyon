title: Subject Pronouns
---

## Definition

As its name suggests, a subject pronoun is used to replace the subject noun of a
sentence.

In English there are seven subject pronouns: "I", "you", "he", "she", "it", "we"
and "they". In Spanish, there are _twelve_: two pronouns take gender (`nosotros`
and `vosotros`), and there are four pronouns for "you".

| Singular    | Plural        |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| yo          | nosotros(as)  |
| tú          | vosotros(as)  |
| usted       | ustedes       |
| él          | ellos         |
| ella        | ellas         |

NB: there is no _"it"_ in Spanish.

## Verb conjugation

The conjugated verb must agree in number(first-/second-/third-person) with the
subject. This is true for `-ar`, `-er` and `-ir` verbs:

| Person        | -ar         | -er           | -ir         |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| 1st           | -o, -amos   | -o, -emos,    | -o, -imos   |
| 2nd           | -as, -áis   | -es, -éis     | -es, -ís    |
| 3rd           | -a, -an     | -e, -en       | -e, -en     |
