## Definition

A prepositinoal pronoun is to replace a noun that names a person or thing
following a preposition, serving as the object of that preposition.

## Standard prepositional pronouns

In the simplest case, prepositional pronouns are nearly identical to the subject
pronouns, except in the first- and second-person singular form, `mí` replaces
`yo` and `ti` replaces `tú`, respectively. Note that `mí` takes an accent to
distinguish it from `mi`, the posessive adjective, which means `my`. Another
exception is for the third-person singular, there is a pronoun for neuter:
`ello`, meaning "it".

Shortcut:
  - 1st person: `mí`
  - 2nd person: `ti`
  - 3rd person:
    - singular: `él`, `ella`, `ello`
  - plural forms are identical to the subject pronouns

## Pronouns with **con**

Certain pronouns change their form when following the preposition **con**
("with"):

| Person    | Singular  | Plural            |
| --------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| 1st       | conmigo   | con nosotoros(as) |
| 2nd       | contigo   | con vosotoros(as) |
| 3rd       | consigo   | consigo           |

Complication:
  - In the third-person forms, singlur or plural, `consigo` is used when the
    subject of the sentence is the same as the object
  - Otherwise, the full form, `con él`, `con ella`, `con usted`, `con ello`,
    `con ellos`, `con ellas`, `con ustedes` should be used.
  - In programming language:
    ```
    if subject == object:
      consigo
    else:
      full form
    ```

## Subject pronouns with prepositions

There are _six_ exceptional prepositions that when preceding a pronoun, the
subject form of the pronoun should be used. These are:

```
entre (between)     menos (except)
excepto (except)    salvo (except)
incluso (including) según (according to)
```

For example:

```
Juan esta entre tú y yo.
Todos bailan excepto él.
```

## Reflexive pronouns following a preposition

Reflexive pronouns are similar to the English counterparts "myself", "yourself",
"himself". When following a prepostion (e.g., `a`), they come in the following
forms:

| Person  | Singular      | Plural                    |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1st     | a mí mismo(a) | a nosotros(as) mismos(as) |
| 2nd     | a ti mismo(a) | a vosotros(as) mismos(as) |
| 3rd     | a sí mismo(a) | a sí mismos(as)           |

Note: singular or plural, the third-person is always `sí`.
